# I'm Måns, Welcome to My GitHub 👋 

This is my personal project space where I explore ideas, experiments, and projects I’m passionate about. 

I focus a lot on AI/ML but I enjoy software development in general as well. Right now I'm exploring building Spring Boot Applications.

Here you’ll find work and my interest in problem-solving, data exploration, and coding challenges.  

Feel free to explore the projects here and get inspired!
